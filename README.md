## OverView
In this activity we prompt the user if they would like to buy an item from our online store that we created on mySQL.

## Process
The user will be prompted to select the items they would like to purchase and the quantity.
If there is enough product in stock the store will update the quantity of the product purchased and show the total cost of the item purchased.

If the ordered quantity exceeds the stock quantity we send an error message.
